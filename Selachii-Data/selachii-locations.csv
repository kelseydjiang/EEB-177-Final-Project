Riabinin (1938:1 [Russian text], 173 [English summary]) stated that the remains of this animal were found “at the foot of an elevation located north of Sumgait River (Djenghi-Chai) at a distance of 3 km from the Djenghi Inn,” but Riabinin did not give his source for that information, which is somewhat different from that of Weber (1928). Mchedlidze (1976 [1984:1]) gave the locality as the “western part of Apsheronsk Peninsula, Dzhangi village.” We have not been able to determine the exact location of the Dzhengi guest house/inn; thus, the exact type locality remains uncertain. The most likely possibilities include outcrops in thePerekishkyul area, which have yielded many fossil whales (Mchedlidze, 1964), or outcrops along the Sumgait River just northeast of the town of Jangi, whose coordinates are 40 300 1000 W, 49 150 5100 E. When we initially looked into this ques- tion, we were confused by the reference to ‘Sumgait River (Dzhengichai)’ until we learned that the two names ‘Sumgait’ ""and ‘Dzhengichai’ (also anglicized as ‘Jangichai’ from Azerbai- jani) both apply to the same river; ‘Dzhengichai’ being its name in the mountainous region west of the Apsheronsk Peninsula and ‘Sumgait’ after it enters the plain at the western margin of the Peninsula and flows northeastward to the coastal town of Sumgait (personal communication, Akif Alizadeh to A.E.S., 2 May 2012). Thus, the name ‘Sumgait River (Dzhengichai)’ means the Dzhengi portion of the river. We have also learned that Weber collected the remains of Mirocetus 15–20 km south-west of the city of Sumgait (pers. comm., A. Alizadeh to A.E.S., 2 May 2012) and, according to Weber (1928), on the right bank of the Dzhengi ( D Jangichai) River, and not on the Sumgait portion of the river as reported by Riabinin (Sanders & Geisler, 2015)."
