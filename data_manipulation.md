# Manipulating Data:

I will first try to categories all the unique number of species under the Elasmobranchii subclass and chart their occurences through the geological eras. Then I will use R to formate the data appropriately and display the graphs with Elasmobranchii Diversity over Time.

Possible Loop:
	
my_file = open ("Elasmobranchii.csv")
formatted_file = accepted_name (all the unique species) + early_interval 

for every species in pbdb_data(\Elasmobranchii|).csv file
	print unique species and corresponding time period
