EEB 177 Final Project Ideas:

I am focusing on three sepcies groups - Sirenia (order), Felidae (family), and Elasmobranchii (subclass).

Project Ideas:
1. With the order of Sirenia, I want to look at the evolutionary history of these herbivorous marine mammals and how they migrated from land to sea. They are the only herbivorous mammmals to have become completely aquatic and I want to see where this diverge occurs in the history. 

2. With the family Felidae, I want to look at the evolutionary trend between this family of big cats and see how they diverge into cats that roar "Pantherinae" and those that do not.

3. With the subclass Elasmobranchii, I chose to look at these species specific to the continent of Asia because I want to study the extinction rates of shark species due to the popular Asian cuisine "Shark Fin Soup." 

Rank:
1. Elasmobranchii (Sharks and Rays)
2. Sirenia (Manatees and Dugongs)
3. Felidae (Big Cats)

Specific Species in Each Category:
1. Sirenia - 167 unique species
2. Felidae - 303 unique species
3. Elasmobranchii - 381 unique species
